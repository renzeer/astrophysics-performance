V0 Observations
	Working from topmost level and finding obvious methods for improvement
	Looking at main()
		Nested for loop structure with 3 levels (Loop1, Loop2, Loop3)
		Use OpenMP to parallelize loops

V1.0, Loop3 parallelized with OpenMP 
	Elapsed time: 116.62 seconds
	Elapsed time: 116.73 seconds

V1.1, Loop3 and Loop2 parallelized with OpenMP
	Elapsed time: 114.73 seconds
	Elapsed time: 118.51 seconds
	Elapsed time: 115.07 seconds

V1.2, All loops parallelized with OpenMP
	Elapsed time: 115.31 seconds
	Elapsed time: 121.82 seconds

V1.3 Enclose loop block into 'omp parallel'

	number of SNII: 26344
	number of SNIa: 2825
	total stellar mass: 3833250.74163964
	Sterilization distance multiplier: 1
	Number density type: 1

	Elapsed time: 124.53 seconds
	Elapsed time: 116.99 seconds

V1.4 Switching scheduling of Loop 1 to dynamic
	number stars: 13497423
 	number of SNII: 26344
 	number of SNIa: 2825
 	total stellar mass: 3833250.74163964
 	Sterilization distance multiplier: 1
 	Number density type: 1

	Elapsed time: 125.94 seconds
	Elapsed time: 120.20 seconds

V1.5 Switching scheduling for all loops to dynamic
	number stars: 13497423
	number of SNII: 26344
	number of SNIa: 2825
	total stellar mass: 3833250.74163964
	Sterilization distance multiplier: 1
	Number density type: 1

	Elapsed time: 116.60 seconds
	Elapsed time: 115.89 seconds

V1.6 Remove omp from inner loops
	number stars: 13497423
	number of SNII: 26344
	number of SNIa: 2825
	total stellar mass: 3833250.74163964
	Sterilization distance multiplier: 1
	Number density type: 1

	Elapsed time: 115.69 seconds
	Elapsed time: 123.38 seconds

V1.7 Suspicious of no improvements, attempt to check if omp is functioning properly by calling omp_get_thread_num()
	Compile error
	Could not find omp_get_thread_num()
	OpenMP library not properly loading

V1.8 Added -fopenmp flag to compiler
	Runtime error
	Threads now properly print but segmentation fault immediately after
	Through debugging, was able to pinpoint problem to 'omp parallel' block
	Limiting threads to 2 and removing omp parallel parameters in an attempt to debug

V1.9 

V1 SUMMARY
	No real improvements through OpenMp. Could possibly use more tweaking, but will move on to version 2 for now with changes intact. Going to continue going for 'low hanging fruit' first and move on to compiler optimization flags.
