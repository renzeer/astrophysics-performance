	Number density type: 1

	Elapsed time: 115.69 seconds
	Elapsed time: 123.38 seconds

V1.7 Suspicious of no improvements, attempt to check if omp is functioning properly by calling omp_get_thread_num()
	Compile error
	Could not find omp_get_thread_num()
	OpenMP library not properly loading

V1.8 Added -fopenmp flag to compiler
	Runtime error
	Threads now properly print but segmentation fault immediately after
	Through debugging, was able to pinpoint problem to 'omp parallel' block
	Limiting threads to 2 and removing omp parallel parameters in an attempt to debug

V1.9 Stripped down omp blocks to single 'omp parallel for' on loop3 with specific parameters
	Ran into too many issues with omp, so backtracked to simplest state to work from ground up
	Have to use static scheduling
	Have to use ordering at second if block (unsure why)
	Still no performance gains, but at least compiles
	Will commit to git at this point before moving on

V1.10
	Unable to get working, running into too many issues
	Decided to rethink approach

V1 SUMMARY
	No improvements at all through OpenMP. Much harder than expected. Loops are complex and cannot be tackled with simple omp blocks. Much more tweaking to do and hopefully we will see results. Next step is to go for easier methods of improvement such as compile optimizations

V2 SUMMARY
 foo
====================

V3.0 Profiling with gprof and running_total
	Used gprof to profile original application
		Found that it sends a lot of time in running_total
		Took a better look at the gprof output and found that although the function has a long cumulative runtime, the time spent inside the actual function is actually reall short. The time stacks up due to the large amount calls made to the function. Parallelzing the loop inside running_total would be useless since it is so fast already. In fact, it adds overhead, causing a slowdown. I added an omp parallel for section within running_total to test this out and th eprogram became unbearably slow.
	Used gprof to profile V1
		No differences from original application
	Used gprof to profile V2
		running_total is no longer listed in the output
		get_star_range function family and process_SN are now the leaders in runtime
		No for loops within get_star_range function family
		Multiple loops within process_SN
		Will attempt to apply omp to loops within process_SN
